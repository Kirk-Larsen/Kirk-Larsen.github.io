The mirrors examined included both single and multilayer optical coatings, as well as an uncoated substrate.

    abstract = {The electronic and nuclear dynamics in methanol, following 156 nm photoexcitation, are investigated by combining a detailed analysis of time-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy experiments with electronic structure calculations. The photoexcitation pump pulse is followed by a delayed 260 nm photoionization probe pulse to produce photoelectrons that are analyzed by velocity map imaging. The yields of mass-resolved ions, measured with similar experimental conditions, are found to exhibit the same time-dependence as specific photoelectron spectral features. Energy-resolved signal onset and decay times are extracted from the measured photoelectron spectra to achieve high temporal resolution, beyond the 20 fs pump and probe pulse durations. When combined with ab initio calculations of selected cuts through the excited state potential energy surfaces, this information allows the dynamics of the transient excited molecule, which exhibits multiple nuclear and electronic degrees of freedom, to be tracked on its intrinsic few-femtosecond time scale. Within 15 fs of photoexcitation, we observe nuclear motion on the initially bound photoexcited 21A″ (S2) electronic state, through a conical intersection with the 11A′ (S3) state, which reveals paths to photodissociation following C–O stretch and C–O–H angle opening.},

Ion-pair formation states of Σg−3 and 3Πg symmetry are accessed through predissociation of optically dark continuum Rydberg states converging to the B Σg−2 ionic state, which are resonantly populated via a mixture of both parallel–parallel and parallel–perpendicular two-photon transitions. This mixture is evident in the angular distribution of the dissociation relative to the light polarization and varies with the kinetic energy release (KER) of the fragmenting ion pair. The KER-dependent photoion angular distribution reveals the underlying two-photon absorption dynamics involved in the ion-pair production mechanism and indicates the existence of two nearly degenerate continuum resonances possessing different symmetries, which can decay by coupling to ion-pair states of the same total symmetry through internal conversion.},

abstract = {We present state-selective measurements on the  + H+ and NH+ + H+ + H dissociation channels following single-photon double ionization at 61.5 eV of neutral NH3, where the two photoelectrons and two cations are measured in coincidence using 3D momentum imaging. Three dication electronic states are identified to contribute to the  + H+ dissociation channel, where the excitation in one of the three states undergoes intersystem crossing prior to dissociation, producing a cold  fragment. In contrast, the other two states directly dissociate, producing a ro-vibrationally excited  fragment with roughly 1 eV of internal energy. The NH+ + H+ + H channel is fed by direct dissociation from three intermediate dication states, one of which is shared with the  + H+ channel. We find evidence of autoionization contributing to each of the double ionization channels. The distributions of the relative emission angle between the two photoelectrons, as well as the relative angle between the recoil axis of the molecular breakup and the polarization vector of the ionizing field, are also presented to provide insight on both the photoionization and photodissociation mechanisms for the different dication states.}

Unlike most traditional lock-in amplifiers, SILIA can work with any number of input channels and is especially useful to analyze data distributed over many channels. We demonstrate the versatility and performance for extracting weak signals in spectroscopy and fluorescence microscopy. We also discuss more general applications and exhibit a method to automatically estimate error from a lock-in result.}

Observing the subsequent fragmentation products in coincidence can reveal a surprisingly detailed picture of the dynamics. Determining the time evolution and quantum mechanical states involved leads to deeper understanding of molecular dynamics. Here in a combined experimental and theoretical study, we unambiguously separate the sequential breakup via D+{\thinspace}+{\thinspace}OD+ intermediates, from other processes leading to the same D+{\thinspace}+{\thinspace}D+{\thinspace}+{\thinspace}O final products of double ionization of water by a single photon. Moreover, we experimentally identify, separate, and follow step by step, two pathways involving the b{\thinspace}1$\Sigma$+ and a 1$\Delta$ electronic states of the intermediate OD+ ion. Our classical trajectory calculations on the relevant potential energy surfaces reproduce well the measured data and, combined with the experiment, enable the determination of the internal energy and angular momentum distribution of the OD+ intermediate.},

We have developed a compact single-shot photon spectrometer to diagnose soft X-ray spectra. The spectrometer consists of an array of off-axis Fresnel zone plates (FZP) that act as transmission-imaging gratings, a Ce:YAG scintillator, and a microscope objective to image the scintillation target onto a two-dimensional imaging detector. This spectrometer operates in segmented energy ranges which covers tens of electronvolts for each absorption edge associated with several atomic constituents: carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and neon. The spectrometer's performance is demonstrated at a repetition rate of 120 Hz, but our detection scheme can be easily extended to 200 kHz spectral collection by employing a fast complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) line-scan camera to detect the light from the scintillator. This compact photon spectrometer provides an opportunity for monitoring the spectrum downstream of an endstation in a limited space environment with sub-electronvolt energy resolution.},

  abstract = {Attosecond-pump/attosecond-probe experiments have long been sought as the most straightforward method for observing electron dynamics in real time. Although there has been much success with overlapped near-infrared femtosecond and extreme ultraviolet attosecond pulses combined with theory, true attosecond-pump/attosecond-probe experiments have been limited. We used a synchronized attosecond x-ray pulse pair from an x-ray free-electron laser to study the electronic response to valence ionization in liquid water through all x-ray attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (AX-ATAS). Our analysis showed that the AX-ATAS response is confined to the subfemtosecond timescale, eliminating any hydrogen atom motion and demonstrating experimentally that the 1b1 splitting in the x-ray emission spectrum is related to dynamics and is not evidence of two structural motifs in ambient liquid water. The low intensity of attosecond pulses remains one of the main challenges in conducting true attosecond-pump/attosecond-probe experiments that could directly observe electron dynamics in real time when all nuclear motions are frozen. Using a recently upgraded x-ray free-electron laser that enables the production and synchronization of two-color attosecond x-ray pulse pairs, Li et al. performed all x-ray attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy measurements on an important condensed phase process: the initial electronic response to valence ionization in liquid water. This work experimentally resolves a long-standing debate around the interpretation of the 1b1 x-ray emission doublet. The presented technique could resolve many complex condensed phase issues for which nuclear motions need to be frozen to capture the information content of the probe signal. —Yury Suleymanov Liquid water was studied using pure x-ray pulses at the subfemtosecond time scale.}

    abstract = {We applied reaction microscopy to elucidate fast non-adiabatic dissociation dynamics of deuterated water molecules after direct photo-double ionization at 61 eV with synchrotron radiation. For the very rare D+ + O+ + D breakup channel, the particle momenta, angular, and energy distributions of electrons and ions, measured in coincidence, reveal distinct electronic dication states and their dissociation pathways via spin–orbit coupling and charge transfer at crossings and seams on the potential energy surfaces. Notably, we could distinguish between direct and fast sequential dissociation scenarios. For the latter case, our measurements reveal the geometry and orientation of the deuterated water molecule with respect to the polarization vector that leads to this rare 3-body molecular breakup channel. Aided by multi-reference configuration-interaction calculations, the dissociation dynamics could be traced on the relevant potential energy surfaces and particularly their crossings and seams. This approach also unraveled the ultrafast time scales governing these processes.},

journal = {Journal of Physics B: Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics},
abstract = {Advances in x-ray free electron lasers have made ultrafast scattering a powerful method for investigating molecular reaction kinetics and dynamics. Accurate measurement of the ground-state, static scattering signals of the reacting molecules is pivotal for these pump-probe x-ray scattering experiments as they are the cornerstone for interpreting the observed structural dynamics. This article presents a data calibration procedure, designed for gas-phase x-ray scattering experiments conducted at the Linac Coherent Light Source x-ray Free-Electron Laser at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, that makes it possible to derive a quantitative dependence of the scattering signal on the scattering vector. A self-calibration algorithm that optimizes the detector position without reference to a computed pattern is introduced. Angle-of-scattering corrections that account for several small experimental non-idealities are reported. Their implementation leads to near quantitative agreement with theoretical scattering patterns calculated with ab-initio methods as illustrated for two x-ray photon energies and several molecular test systems.}

  abstract = {We report the measurement of impulsive stimulated x-ray Raman scattering in neutral liquid water. An attosecond pulse drives the excitations of an electronic wavepacket in water molecules. The process comprises two steps: a transition to core-excited states near the oxygen atoms accompanied by transition to valence-excited states. Thus, the wavepacket is impulsively created at a specific atomic site within a few hundred attoseconds through a nonlinear interaction between the water and the x-ray pulse. We observe this nonlinear signature in an intensity-dependent Stokes Raman sideband at 526 eV. Our measurements are supported by our state-of-the-art calculations based on the polarization response of water dimers in bulk solvation and propagation of attosecond x-ray pulses at liquid density. Attosecond x-ray pulses create time and space localized electronic excitations in water that are read-out in the x-ray signal.}

Our design features a 2 m long electron drift tube and electrostatic retardation lens, achieving sub-electronvolt (eV) electron kinetic energy resolution for high energy (several hundred eV) electrons with a close to 4π collection solid angle. A segmented anode electron detector enables the simultaneous collection of photoelectron spectra in high resolution and high collection efficiency modes. This versatile instrument is installed at the time-resolved molecular and optical sciences instrument at the Linac Coherent Light Source x-ray free-electron laser (XFEL). In this paper, we demonstrate its high resolution, collection efficiency, and spatial selectivity in measurements where it is coupled to an XFEL source. These combined characteristics are designed to enable high-resolution time-resolved measurements using x-ray photoelectron, absorption, and Auger–Meitner spectroscopy. We also describe the pervasive artifact in MBES time-of-flight spectra that arises from a periodic modulation in electron collection efficiency and present a robust analysis procedure for its removal.},

    abstract = {We investigated the ultrafast structural dynamics of cyclobutanone following photoexcitation at λ = 200 nm using gas-phase megaelectronvolt ultrafast electron diffraction. Our investigation complements the simulation studies of the same process within this special issue. It provides information about both electronic state population and structural dynamics through well-separable inelastic and elastic electron scattering signatures. We observe the depopulation of the photoexcited S2 state of cyclobutanone with n3s Rydberg character through its inelastic electron scattering signature with a time constant of (0.29 ± 0.2) ps toward the S1 state. The S1 state population undergoes ring-opening via a Norrish Type-I reaction, likely while passing through a conical intersection with S0. The corresponding structural changes can be tracked by elastic electron scattering signatures. These changes appear with a delay of (0.14 ± 0.05) ps with respect to the initial photoexcitation, which is less than the S2 depopulation time constant. This behavior provides evidence for the ballistic nature of the ring-opening once the S1 state is reached. The resulting biradical species react further within (1.2 ± 0.2) ps via two rival fragmentation channels yielding ketene and ethylene, or propene and carbon monoxide. Our study showcases the value of both gas-phase ultrafast diffraction studies as an experimental benchmark for nonadiabatic dynamics simulation methods and the limits in the interpretation of such experimental data without comparison with such simulations.},
