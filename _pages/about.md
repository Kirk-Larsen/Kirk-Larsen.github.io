I am an associate staff scientist in the Laser Science Department of the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory. I provide operational laser support for the Coherent X-ray Imaging (CXI) instrument at LCLS. I work on developing tunable few-cycle UV light sources using soliton dynamics and resonant dispersive wave emission in hollow core fibers. I am involved in photoinjector research for LCLS-II, focusing on temporal x-ray pulse shaping to support the extension of attosecond capabilities to high repetition rate. I also work on developing plasma based attosecond XUV light sources at FACET-II.
