I am an associate staff scientist in the Laser Science Department of the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory. I provide operational laser support for the Coherent X-ray Imaging (CXI) instrument at LCLS. I work on developing tunable few-cycle UV light sources using soliton dynamics and resonant dispersive wave emission in hollow core fibers. I am involved in photoinjector research for LCLS-II, focusing on temporal x-ray pulse shaping to support the extension of attosecond capabilities to high repetition rate. I also work on developing plasma based attosecond XUV light sources at FACET-II.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
