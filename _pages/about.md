I am an associate scientist in the [Laser Sciences Department](https://lcls.slac.stanford.edu/depts/lasers) of the [Linac Coherent Light Source](https://lcls.slac.stanford.edu/) (LCLS) at [SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory](https://www6.slac.stanford.edu/). I provide operational laser support for the [Coherent X-ray Imaging](https://lcls.slac.stanford.edu/instruments/cxi) (CXI) instrument at LCLS. I work on developing tunable few-cycle UV light sources using soliton dynamics and resonant dispersive wave emission in hollow capillary fibers. I am involved in photoinjector research for LCLS-II, focusing on temporal x-ray pulse shaping to support the extension of attosecond capabilities to high repetition rate. I also work on developing plasma based attosecond XUV light sources at [FACET-II](https://facet-ii.slac.stanford.edu/).
