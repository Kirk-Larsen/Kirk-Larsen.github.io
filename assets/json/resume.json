    "summary": "I am an associate scientist in the Laser Science Department at the Linac Coherent Light Source. I am generally interested in understanding how photon driven electronic motion and coherence in gas- and condensed-phase systems initiates chemical dynamics, charge transfer and energy transport. These processes can occur on few- to sub-femtosecond timescale (i.e. attoseconds). My research harnesses recent breakthroughs in ultrafast coherent light source development to gain insights into these processes. These advancements in light source technologies include both table-top lasers (nonlinear optics in hollow capillary fibers) and large-scale accelerators (advanced beam physics and accelerator methods).",
